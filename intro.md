# Introduction to Python Programming for research with Jupyter Notebooks: Description

## Overview

The goal of this workshop is to teach novice programmers to write code in PYthon for data analysis. Python is a free, open source and cross-platform software that can do anything from creating stand along software and websites, to performing scientific computations and advanced text analysis. It is used in the academic realm for collecting, organizing, processing, and visualizing datasets. Python is commonly used in the academic realm for scientific computing, web scraping, data science and machine learning, as well as natural language processing. The primary philosophy of Python is to make a programming language that is easy for humans to read, making it an ideal "first language" to learn.

The emphasis of this workshop is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of Python, including syntax (what you write when writing python programs) jargon (how you talk about programming with programmers) and fundamental concepts (what is actually happening when your computer runs code). Because Python is used in a wide variety of ways in the academic realm, we can't teach you how to write the exact program you need to write, but this class will provide the foundation to teach youreself the functions and libraries* you need to 

<!-- and to teach them how to use the packages from R to manipulate, analyse and visualise data. This workshop is also intended as an opportunity for attendees to meet and network with the community that is actively using R for research. -->

<!-- *Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis. If you would like help with your statistical analysis, you can contact the [Statistical Consulting Centre](http://www.scc.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) for one-on-one consultations statistical training courses.* -->

*A variety of third party libraries are used throughout this workshop. These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are ones that we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.*

### Learning objectives

This training aims to enable students to:

- Use the Jupyter notebook interface effectively.
  
- Understand the different types of data and two types of data structures in Python (the list and the Dictionary).
  
- Apply Logic using if statements and iterate through data structures using a for loops.
  
- Create functions to reuse sets of code and return data.

- Understand the concepts of mutability, iterability, and scope.

### Learning outcomes

- The ability to generate reproducible analysis of quantitative data using data analysis and visualisation tools.
  
- Computational skills: The ability to adapt existing computational methods and tools to complete a target task.
  
- Problem solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies.
  
- Collaborative skills: the ability to work in a team.

### Training Format

#### Virtual Training

The Introduction to Python workshop consists of two 4-hour parts. Sessions start with a half hour zoom session, followed by self paced modules, with the instructor and reslead volunteer assistants on slack to discuss challenges at the end of the 4 hour session.

- **Duration:** 8 hours.
  
- **Frequency:** Monthly.
  
- **Mode of presentation:** 2 hours of with a 5% e-learning video component.

#### In Person Training

The Introduction to Python workshop consists of two 4-hour sessions. Both sessions are run on two nights on the the same week.

- **Duration:** 8 hours.
  
- **Frequency:** Monthly.
  
- **Mode of presentation:** Physical presence with a 5% e-learning video component.
  
- **Materials**: Participants can follow the [course material online](TODO: JEREMY LINK). Students also have access to a [jupyter book](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/content/01-rstudio-intro.html) that explores the concepts introduced in the workshop in more depth.

## Eligibility requirements

This workshop is accessible to everyone. We encourage non-coders and people from different backgrounds and skills to register for the training.

### Prerequisites

**NO previous knowledge is required.**

### Recommended background knowledge

For those with no previous programming experience, we recommend consulting the course materials for [introduction to programming concepts](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-programming-concepts/content/content/welcome-to-coding.html ) prior to attending the current workshop.

### Participation requirements

- **To work through binderhub instances of the materials** Participants just need a computer with internet access and a browser

- **To install Python on their laptop** Participants must bring a laptop and charger with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, ipad etc.) in which they have administrative privileges on. Installation instructions for python are found [here](https://github.com/resbaz/Intro_Python_Nov2017/blob/master/Python_Installation.md) 


## Assessment and expectations

- We encourage participants to come with an open mind and participate in discussions with others.
  
- This workshop is a hands on training. We expect participants to code and ask questions to the trainer and, more importantly, to other students.

- Particpants are expected to work in teams during the day.

- Participants will be asked to self-assess their progress and understanding of concepts.

- Students are expected to provide feedback to improve the course.
