# VALA Tech Camp introduction to python course

This course is designed for library associated folks who have never used python or any programming language before, but are interested in learning some of the basics, as well as seeing what it can do to help manage metadata!

### Wondering how Python is used for research? Watch this video!

These tutorials will be using Python 3.9 inside the Jupyter Notebook. You can run python through a Jupyter notebook by either, using a free cloud service (easier option), or installing Python and jupyter notebooks on your own machine (harder option)


## Running Python for this workshop:

### In the cloud:

Not sure if you want to go through the hassle of installing python? Then You can run this repository on a cloud instance, and try before you buy!

There are two ways to do this. One is to open up the repository in Binder, a free cloud machine that will allow you to run all the notebooks. Click on the "launch binder" button below to create your own personal jupyter cloud machine!

(**Note:** If you do not run a code cell for 15 minutes, the session will time out and you will have to click on this button again)

The other option is to use a google collaboratory notebook (aka "google collab"), which is essentially the google docs of Jupyter notebooks. Buttons to open up the four parts of our workshop can be found in the table below.

<h4> How do I install Python on my own machine? </h4>

Check out the [installation instructions](Python_Installation.md). **Note** You do NOT have to do this, by clicking on the "launch binder" button below, you can use a free cloud instance of our repository with everything set up and ready to go!
